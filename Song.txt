# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Did you ever see a goose
Kissing a moose?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go.
For if I do,
My Mother will say:

"Did you ever see a parrot
Eating a carrot?"
Down by the bay.
